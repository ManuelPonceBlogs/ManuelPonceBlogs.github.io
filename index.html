			I grew up here in Austin, TX. I graduated from Austin High School right downtown next to Zilker Park, so pretty much as Austin as it gets. 
			The only extra curricular activity I did in highschool was play fútbol since I have played that since I was a very small child. 
			
			<br><br> Choosing to attend UT Austin was my only option since I wanted to stay in Austin. It was also the only school I applied to after attending Austin
			Community for two years. Picking CS as a major was a mistake because at ACC I followed the wrong degree plan but by the time I figured that out I basically 
			was done with my two years there.
			
			<br><br> The reason I am in this class is to create some cool web app with others. I would like it to recreate the work enviroment that we are presented with 
			at internships since that is when I have felt like I learn the most in this field. My expectations for this class are not much. I think it will be very 
			independent learning and time heavy. The cold calling is something that I personally do not like. Mostly because I live at home where there is a million 
			distractions out of my control and sometimes have to be called out of my room randomly during class to handle things for my parents or pets or brother so I might miss the
			part where I get called and don't answer.
			
			<br><br> Recently, since I cannot play fútbol because of the situation in the United States, I have picked up Skateboarding. And yesterday I finally was able to drop 
			in to the big mini ramp at the skatepark so that made me happy.

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention. One thing I did was read some of my classmates' first blog posts to get to know people in my class this semester in case I do end up on their team, I'll have a very minimal background on them.
			
			<br><br> WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			For me, there's only so much I can understand from just being shown a screen about things like the makefile. When I do learn it is when it is hands-on, so when eventually we make our makefile or have to work with one, I do think my understanding will be greater than what it currently is. 
			
			<br><br> WHAT WILL YOU DO THIS WEEK?_
			This upcoming week I plan to attend lectures again, be better prepared for the quizzes and start the project. From what was explained about the project in the last lecture, it seems that it will be a lot and I am kinda intimidated by the whole workflow aspect more so than the coding part. Hopefully, I start it on Monday so in case I get stuck early I can take advantage of the TA office hours.
			
			<br><br> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE MAKEFILE?_
			overall looking at it as a whole I do see its purpose but when I start looking at individual lines I definitely get lost in the sauce. I do try my best to google most things that I cannot understand while I am reading the file. I do like how this given makefile has things very organized and comments that help out a lot so that was nice. Again, working on this file during the project will help me out to learn this material.
			
			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH DOCKER?_
			I have no successful experience with docker. In community college one of my CS professors was obsessed with this technology but I did not understand what he was talking about at all in class since it was a Comp Arch class. He gave us an extra credit assignment about using docker to run anything cool. I tried using docker to set up a video game lobby but failed since this was like my second semester in a CS class. 

			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH ASSERTIONS?_
			Assertions are cool to me. I have used them plenty of times in my code when I needed to make sure my code was running through a specific block of code. I mostly rely on print statements but when that fails I resort to assertions so definitely not using them how this class and other more professional codebases are using them. Hopefully, I can build up my skills to get to that point when using this tool.

			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH UNIT TESTS?_
			I have written unit tests for classes before but I know for a fact they were not good. Nobody wants to write tests for the simple code we have written in the past. I do have also experience writing unit tests a little in my internships but mainly it's better to write functional tests. 
			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			I got new soccer cleats. Even though I cannot use them, they'll be there when the time comes. 
			<br><br> PICK OF THE WEEK_
			I have always been a big fan of music and creation of music. Looking into what I could do with this class and a web project,I found Jukebox from OpenAI. It is a neural net that generates music, including rudimentary singing, as raw audio in a variety of genres and artist styles. I think it would be cool to integrate this into a website people could use to make sounds.

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention. Participated in the in class coding with the breakrooms and was cool to meet some students in the class. I also installed the Docker container for the class but have no idea how it works.
			
			<br><br> WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			Personally nothing is in my way except my procrastination and I usually do my best work during crunch time. 
			
			<br><br> WHAT WILL YOU DO THIS WEEK?_
			This upcoming week I plan to attend lectures again and actively try to pay attention. For sure this week I will have to start the project and probably work on it straight until I finish it since I am starting it late. 
			
			<br><br> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE CONTINOUS INTEGRATION PAPER?_
			I thought it was a very interesting paper. Made some really good points about the reason for continuos integration. In past iternships I have used this technology but never really knew what it was. I mostly used it to make sure my code passed the new tests and old tests and didnt break anything that was in production.
			
			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF COLLATZ?_
			As I write this I have yet to start the collatz project, from what I have read from peoples posts, it seems that the answers are all over the place. Hopefully I am able to complete it but overall it is my own fault if I do not for starting so late.  

			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH EXCEPTIONS?_
			Exceptions were cool to see when I was working on code in 314. Seeing exceptions like ClassNotFoundException, StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and my favorite NullPointerException, meant I did something wrong but I knew what was wrong from those specific exceptions. I am not sure what the difference between assertions and exceptions but they are both good when developing new and exsisting code.

			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			Having started skateboarding during quarentine and actually being able to see myself progress and learn something made me happy this week becuase I was able to land three new tricks I previously could not do.

			<br><br> PICK OF THE WEEK_
			After writing my experience with exceptions and assertions I needed some clarification. Read multiple things but this stackoverflow thread was pretty good to understand the difference.

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention. I worked on the collatz project on Monday and Tuesday. Overall the project was ok. I get that it was like a warm up to get used to how a similar workflow would work when we begin our team projects. The biggest problem I had last week was getting the docker image or docker in general to correctly work on my windows laptop to be able to use the tools. I ended up SSH’ing into a school computer and running the tools that way. 
			
			<br><br>WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			The only real technical thing is figuring out my docker situation and have it up and running before we begin the next group projects. My workflow wasn't bad when I used the SSH method, so if I see that working for the rest of the projects that would be dope.  If not, I’ll keep reading Piazza or go to office hours to get help.  
			
			<br><br>WHAT WILL YOU DO THIS WEEK?_
			This week I am not sure what is going on in class. I will need to check the schedule to see if anything specific will go down. Anyways I will do the usual stuff like attend  lectures and participate on the quizzes.  
			
			<br><br>WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE PAIR PROGRAMMING PAPER?_
			The pair programming article was pretty straight forward. I feel like I have read many articles like it in almost every other class that had any partner or group projects so I do not think it was anything that new. The one thing I did not know about was Extreme Programming and thought that was different and interesting. Personally I would not like to do that full time but maybe it’ll be cool to try it out. 

			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF TYPES?_
			So this question is kinda sus. I am assuming it means ‘types’ as in Int, Float, Char, Doubles etc.? I know what they are in programming in general as data types. I am not too sure as how deep they go or how they are truly represented. I know some languages can have custom data types and even edit the existing data types to cover your needs.  But to answer the question, my experience is using them since I took my first programming class. 

			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			This song :) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYGPcfUqzL0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank>resume">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYGPcfUqzL0</a>

			<br><br>PICK OF THE WEEK_
			I know this is not too recent but I do think it is important that students who did not know about how our own school cs department was contributing to the social injustice people are fighting for today.

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention for the most part. I took part in the breakout room exercise and we did pretty well. Besides that, talk with my team is very minimal to non-existant but we'll pick it up hopefully. 			
			<br><br>WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			Nothing really out of my control is in my way anymore. Personally I have just been working on all my other classes becuase they seem to be easier to tackle the problems since they are not heavily team based. One thing that I guess I have struggled with is getting accustomed to is being good at using TEAMS from Microsoft. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?_
			Next week should be crunch time with my team and I. We have a plan to meet for the first time on Sunday 2/28 to see whats up with the project. Hopefully a full week will be enought to takle everything phase one requires. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE PAPER?_ 
			I had some good insight into new views of principles I had not been introduced to before. Seeing the paper was from a long time ago, and some quick googling about SRP showed also other sources from early 2000s, made it seem that this principle died out. I am not sure if that is truly the case but that is the biggest take away I got from the paper.  
			
			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH IDB1 AND REDUCE?_
			I'll talk about reduce since I know what that means. It seems that in past experiences I have used similar wrapper functions to take a function, a collection, and an initial single value and return the new final value. I have no idea what IDB1 means but i think it has to do with phase one? Either way I dont have experience with it since I have not started with my group on it.
		
			<br><br>HOW DID YOU FARE IN THE STORM_
			This storm was not chill at all. My power held strong at the biggining but was shotty towards Saturday and Sunday. The worst part was not having water for like 5 days. Fortunately I was able to head to my brothers place since they were not as bad and had water and power for the most part. Besides trying to stay warm I was helping my neighborhood by going around giving clean water since my father and one of our neighbors had a huge water tank that could be filled with water coming from Dripping Springs and Johnson City area. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			Kero Kero Bonito dropped a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncBPcx4RdbE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank>resume">NEW_SONG (click me to listen)</a> and has feel good vibes so that made me happy lisening to it. But yea also the storm ending was a good thing

			<br><br>PICK OF THE WEEK_
			Since all of this work from home or zoom univeristy is still happening, I think its always good to make sure ya'll are keeping up with your individual health. So here is a quick read and a poster check. :)

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention for the most part. I took part in the breakout room exercise and we did pretty well. The team and I began working on phase one of the project. My biggest contributions to this phase was completing the splash page and writing most of the technical report. I helped out a little on the about us page but not much. Made sure things were going smoothly on our gitlab like closing issues and assigning things to the correct people. We also had a few zoom meeting where we worked together as a team to figure out major things we needed to address like our API. Overall the team work this past week was awesome and I am loooking forward to working on the upcoming phases.		
			<br><br>WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			This past week the only thing in my way was the amount of work I had to do outside this class. Felt like every class had to schedule all assignements this past week due to the storm and just made it seem like I was putting in 16+ hour work days to get caught up with all classes. Hopefully things are going to be spread out again as things try to go back to normal as can be.
			
			<br><br>WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?_
			Next week I plan to continue to attend lectures, prepare and take the quizes, and do any inclass group assignments. Also will begin to look at phase two and be prepared to work on anything my team needs me to. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE OPEN-CLOSED PRINCIPLE?_ 
			I see that this principle is what we, as students at the Univeristy of Texas at Austin, are instructed from basically day one of learning to code here. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH ITERATORS AND REDUCE2?_
			Personally this weeks lectures on both of these topics was the first time like I knew exactly what was going on during class. I was able to follow along clearly and put it into the group based practice in class. Python is something crazy and definitely need to brush up on shortcuts when writing code. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			
			This week the thing that made me happy was listening to all my CDs. Especially all my Daft Punk ones since they decided to retire so it was kind of a sad/happy moment becuase it seems like we will not get more music from them, but going back and listening to their tunes was a good time.

			<br><br>PICK OF THE WEEK_
			My pick of the week is this interesting article about NFTs (Non-fungible token) and how they are being auctioned off by famous people. A non-fungible token is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not mutually interchangeable. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and many network or utility tokens, that are fungible in nature.

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention for the most part. I took part in the breakout room exercise and we did pretty well. The team and I began working on phase two of the project. Met up with the team to discuss our backend solution with our database and how it would be stored on AWS RDS. We then had a second meeting and went over our UML Diagram to solidify the structure of our tables in our MySQL database stored in RDS.
			
			<br><br>WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			The thing in my way is this mentality that it will be spring break this week. After a week of everything being due and midterms in other classes, a rest is needed but seems that I will still need to do a lot of work over the break, which seems to so much not be a break. But besides that no blockers on my end for this class. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?_
			Next week I will not attend class lectures or take quizzes. Hopefully, I am going to be in chill mode for spring break, but more realistically I will work on some backend code to the project and more of the front end to the splash page section.
			
			<br><br>WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE?_ 
			This paper built off of the Open-Close Principle in the last paper and they both seem to be very important when taking into account Object-Oriented Design. It seems that there are more principles that will be the foundations of OOD and I am looking forward to reading those if we have papers for them.
			
			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH ITERATION, COMPREHENDIONS, GENERATORS, AND DIGITS ITERATOR?_
			All the topics this week were self-explanatory besides comprehensions. The digits iterator in-class assignment was really simple to implement but gave good hands-on experience on the topic. For comprehensions a did have to go look at more examples online but seems to have helped clear up the confusion I had. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			Working on my iOS app for another class has been really fun since I would like to go into mobile app development as a career.
			
			<br><br>PICK OF THE WEEK_
			My pick this week is sharing that CSS can be made easier and more beautiful to read by using Sass. Check out the link to see the difference between CSS and Sass.	
			
			<br><br><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-css-and-scss/#:~:text=SCSS%20contains%20all%20the%20features,great%20advantage%20over%20conventional%20CSS." rel="noopener noreferrer">Link to the difference between CSS and Sass.</a>

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention for the most part. I took part in the breakout room exercise and we did pretty well. The team and I began working on phase two of the project. The team and I have continued working on our project and made really good progress. I know for a fact this phasse, I have been terrible with my contribution. Being flooded with two other CS classes, also with group projects makes it hard to manage equal contributions to all. I do believe tho my contributions to this phase have been beneficial though to the overall quality of the website.
			
			<br><br>WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			My biggest problem that I have noticed since I have only worked on frontend is getting the CSS correctly to work dynamically when browsers change in size. A lot of the functionality looks good on a regular sized window but once on mobile or making the window smallers, a lot of the layout goes bad. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?_
			Next week I will attend class lectures and take quizzes, maybe participate in breakout room assignments if we have any. Hopefully, the team and I will meet up before monday night to finalize the work we did for phase one and make sure we have met the requirements. 
			
			<br><br>IF YOU READ IT, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE?_ 
			Reading about another principle in software engineering is always important. I did enjoy the parts on delegation and seeing examples on it. I have used delegations a lot when developing on swift and it was cool seeing how it can work outside of it too. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF COMPREHENSIONS, YIELD, CLOSURES, AND DECORATORS?_
			This topic was all over the place for me when first being covered in lecture. After the quiz on friday, I was so lucky that Downing called me to answer the quiz question. That's when I decided to look like a fool and let him know that I was completely lost. Fortunately I have no problem looking dumb since it is a learning opertunity that really cleared up my understanding of those topics.
			
			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			Being a HUGE music fan, i finally completed my music setup to listen to all my cassettes, CDs, and vinyls; this made me really happy this week. The equipent is all mid 1980's Japan made vintage units. I dont think words can describe how good it sounds.

			<br><br>PICK OF THE WEEK_
			My pick this week is sharing this super neat CSS tutorial on transitions for images on hover. This was used to make our static image look animated. This helped on our project becuase it made it look like our slash page image was actually like a gif and that just added another layer of experience a user will gain when visiting the site..

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention for the most part. I failed the quizzes but it is my fault for not being prepared with the information. I also took part in the breakout room exercise and we did not do well at all. The team and I met up and made our final implementations to phase two before we decided to turn it in. Looking back at this phase it was crazy packed with a lot of backend work. Hopefully no more major work needs to be done and its just refinement. 
			
            <br><br>WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			I do not think anything is in my way. I am making sure to get ahead on other class work I have so I can focus a lot more time for this phase since I think I need to step up my contributions to the project.
            
			<br><br>WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?_
			Next week I will attend class lectures and take quizzes, maybe participate in breakout room assignments if we have any. I plan to start working on phase three and I'd like to take charge on the site wide search bar functionality. I would like to also add to our API with something like 'space picture of the day' were someone can pull from the api a random picture to show.
			
			<br><br>IF YOU READ IT, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE?_ 
			It was a good read. Gives more insight into how to be a better developer by having more efficient designs.
			
			<br><br>WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF +, *, ** AND DECORATORS?_
			I thought it was a little bit confusing at first. I definitely need to read up on this on my own becuase it seems important in the Python language.
			
			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
            This week i got my first dose of the COVID vaccine. This made me happy as I see it one small step closer to how normal things were before :)
						
			<br><br>PICK OF THE WEEK_
			This week I decided to pick a tech news article related to a breach of information of Ubiquiti and how the company lied about the severity of the attack. A hacker gained full read and write access to their database that was stored on Amazon Web Services. This is insane becuase this is something most teams in this class have data being stored in Amazon Web Services and eventhough our data was public before, we'd never want our servies to be hacked.
            
            <br><br><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link to the Article.</a>

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention for the most part. I passed the quizzes so that was a good change from last week when I failed them.  I also took part in the breakout room exercise and we did a lot better compared to last week. I began working on my issues on gitlab on my local branch on my machine but have yet to push the changes to github since I was waiting for the grade of phase 2. 
			
            <br><br>WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			I have recently had to pickup extra shifts of work since I have encountered some personal reasons for it. This has really made my time management for school be off but I will still try my best to participate and contribute as best as I can to this class. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?_
			Next week I will attend class lectures and take quizzes, maybe participate in breakout room assignments if we have any. Using the extension of phase 3 to implement the remaining issues for me on gitlab. I am most looking forward to the one issue were the website displays astronomy pictures provided by nasa from a telescope, since those look coolest. 
			
			<br><br>IF YOU READ IT, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE WHY GETTER AND SETTER METHODS ARE EVIL?_ 
			I read it very quickly but was surprised about the claim this author was making. After finishing it, I was not convinced about the claims. I explained this paper to some people I know who are currently years into their software engineering career and they also did not understand the claim made in the paper.  
			
			<br><br>WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF SELECT, PROJECT, CROSS JOIN AND THETA JOIN?_
			Again like most other weeks, it starts rough undertanding these topics since they seem very pythony but the more we go through it it slowly begins to make sense. 
			
			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
            The extension for phase 3 was the best thing I have heard in a while. :)
						
			<br><br>PICK OF THE WEEK_
			NASA has a sick API you can use to make awesome things with the information it gives. 
            <br><br><a href="https://api.nasa.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link to the API.</a>
