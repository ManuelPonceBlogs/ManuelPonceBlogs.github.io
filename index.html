			Potosí, the worlds first capatilist society in the 16th century. The original mining industry was ran by 
			dominant elites, first ingiginous then Spanish, who was then carried out by the peoples known as
			Yanaconas. This was done by the technology that was put in place in Potosi by the mass industrialization of silver there.

		<div class="panel allText">
			The early production of silver consisted of the huayras. They were highly efficient smelters of high-grade 
			silver ores, but they required fuel that most used llama dung or moss found at high altitudes.

		<button class="accordion allText">Amalgamation_</button>
		<div class="panel allText">Once Potosi had gone through most of its fine silver ore. 
			The introduction of Amalgamation helped produce more of the silver that was desired. 
			The process consisted of water mills like the one shown, to brake down the less pure ores 
			found deeper in the mine which was then mixed with mercury to help seperate the good metals from the rock.

				<button class="accordion allText">Water_</button>
		<div class="panel allText">
			Hydrolics played a huge role in the mass production of silver in Potosi. From transporting the ore into the city
			to powering the refaining mills. This led to the engineering of canals, pulleys, water beds, and dams.

		<div class="panel allText">
			These coins where traded all around the world and Potosi was the leading producer of silver mint.
			The early coins of the Spanish were roughly shaped and only pressed with marks of the mint. 
			Problems with counterfeit were met around 1650s and new measures had to be taken.

		<div class="panel allText">
			Not just silver coins were shaped out but also decorative items that could also be traded around the world
