			I grew up here in Austin, TX. I graduated from Austin High School right downtown next to Zilker Park, so pretty much as Austin as it gets. 
			The only extra curricular activity I did in highschool was play fútbol since I have played that since I was a very small child. 
			
			<br><br> Choosing to attend UT Austin was my only option since I wanted to stay in Austin. It was also the only school I applied to after attending Austin
			Community for two years. Picking CS as a major was a mistake because at ACC I followed the wrong degree plan but by the time I figured that out I basically 
			was done with my two years there.
			
			<br><br> The reason I am in this class is to create some cool web app with others. I would like it to recreate the work enviroment that we are presented with 
			at internships since that is when I have felt like I learn the most in this field. My expectations for this class are not much. I think it will be very 
			independent learning and time heavy. The cold calling is something that I personally do not like. Mostly because I live at home where there is a million 
			distractions out of my control and sometimes have to be called out of my room randomly during class to handle things for my parents or pets or brother so I might miss the
			part where I get called and don't answer.
			
			<br><br> Recently, since I cannot play fútbol because of the situation in the United States, I have picked up Skateboarding. And yesterday I finally was able to drop 
			in to the big mini ramp at the skatepark so that made me happy.

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention. One thing I did was read some of my classmates' first blog posts to get to know people in my class this semester in case I do end up on their team, I'll have a very minimal background on them.
			
			<br><br> WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			For me, there's only so much I can understand from just being shown a screen about things like the makefile. When I do learn it is when it is hands-on, so when eventually we make our makefile or have to work with one, I do think my understanding will be greater than what it currently is. 
			
			<br><br> WHAT WILL YOU DO THIS WEEK?_
			This upcoming week I plan to attend lectures again, be better prepared for the quizzes and start the project. From what was explained about the project in the last lecture, it seems that it will be a lot and I am kinda intimidated by the whole workflow aspect more so than the coding part. Hopefully, I start it on Monday so in case I get stuck early I can take advantage of the TA office hours.
			
			<br><br> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE MAKEFILE?_
			overall looking at it as a whole I do see its purpose but when I start looking at individual lines I definitely get lost in the sauce. I do try my best to google most things that I cannot understand while I am reading the file. I do like how this given makefile has things very organized and comments that help out a lot so that was nice. Again, working on this file during the project will help me out to learn this material.
			
			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH DOCKER?_
			I have no successful experience with docker. In community college one of my CS professors was obsessed with this technology but I did not understand what he was talking about at all in class since it was a Comp Arch class. He gave us an extra credit assignment about using docker to run anything cool. I tried using docker to set up a video game lobby but failed since this was like my second semester in a CS class. 

			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH ASSERTIONS?_
			Assertions are cool to me. I have used them plenty of times in my code when I needed to make sure my code was running through a specific block of code. I mostly rely on print statements but when that fails I resort to assertions so definitely not using them how this class and other more professional codebases are using them. Hopefully, I can build up my skills to get to that point when using this tool.

			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH UNIT TESTS?_
			I have written unit tests for classes before but I know for a fact they were not good. Nobody wants to write tests for the simple code we have written in the past. I do have also experience writing unit tests a little in my internships but mainly it's better to write functional tests. 
			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			I got new soccer cleats. Even though I cannot use them, they'll be there when the time comes. 
			<br><br> PICK OF THE WEEK_
			I have always been a big fan of music and creation of music. Looking into what I could do with this class and a web project,I found Jukebox from OpenAI. It is a neural net that generates music, including rudimentary singing, as raw audio in a variety of genres and artist styles. I think it would be cool to integrate this into a website people could use to make sounds.

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention. Participated in the in class coding with the breakrooms and was cool to meet some students in the class. I also installed the Docker container for the class but have no idea how it works.
			
			<br><br> WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			Personally nothing is in my way except my procrastination and I usually do my best work during crunch time. 
			
			<br><br> WHAT WILL YOU DO THIS WEEK?_
			This upcoming week I plan to attend lectures again and actively try to pay attention. For sure this week I will have to start the project and probably work on it straight until I finish it since I am starting it late. 
			
			<br><br> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE CONTINOUS INTEGRATION PAPER?_
			I thought it was a very interesting paper. Made some really good points about the reason for continuos integration. In past iternships I have used this technology but never really knew what it was. I mostly used it to make sure my code passed the new tests and old tests and didnt break anything that was in production.
			
			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF COLLATZ?_
			As I write this I have yet to start the collatz project, from what I have read from peoples posts, it seems that the answers are all over the place. Hopefully I am able to complete it but overall it is my own fault if I do not for starting so late.  

			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH EXCEPTIONS?_
			Exceptions were cool to see when I was working on code in 314. Seeing exceptions like ClassNotFoundException, StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and my favorite NullPointerException, meant I did something wrong but I knew what was wrong from those specific exceptions. I am not sure what the difference between assertions and exceptions but they are both good when developing new and exsisting code.

			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			Having started skateboarding during quarentine and actually being able to see myself progress and learn something made me happy this week becuase I was able to land three new tricks I previously could not do.

			<br><br> PICK OF THE WEEK_
			After writing my experience with exceptions and assertions I needed some clarification. Read multiple things but this stackoverflow thread was pretty good to understand the difference.

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention. I worked on the collatz project on Monday and Tuesday. Overall the project was ok. I get that it was like a warm up to get used to how a similar workflow would work when we begin our team projects. The biggest problem I had last week was getting the docker image or docker in general to correctly work on my windows laptop to be able to use the tools. I ended up SSH’ing into a school computer and running the tools that way. 
			
			<br><br>WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			The only real technical thing is figuring out my docker situation and have it up and running before we begin the next group projects. My workflow wasn't bad when I used the SSH method, so if I see that working for the rest of the projects that would be dope.  If not, I’ll keep reading Piazza or go to office hours to get help.  
			
			<br><br>WHAT WILL YOU DO THIS WEEK?_
			This week I am not sure what is going on in class. I will need to check the schedule to see if anything specific will go down. Anyways I will do the usual stuff like attend  lectures and participate on the quizzes.  
			
			<br><br>WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE PAIR PROGRAMMING PAPER?_
			The pair programming article was pretty straight forward. I feel like I have read many articles like it in almost every other class that had any partner or group projects so I do not think it was anything that new. The one thing I did not know about was Extreme Programming and thought that was different and interesting. Personally I would not like to do that full time but maybe it’ll be cool to try it out. 

			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF TYPES?_
			So this question is kinda sus. I am assuming it means ‘types’ as in Int, Float, Char, Doubles etc.? I know what they are in programming in general as data types. I am not too sure as how deep they go or how they are truly represented. I know some languages can have custom data types and even edit the existing data types to cover your needs.  But to answer the question, my experience is using them since I took my first programming class. 

			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			This song :) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYGPcfUqzL0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank>resume">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYGPcfUqzL0</a>

			<br><br>PICK OF THE WEEK_
			I know this is not too recent but I do think it is important that students who did not know about how our own school cs department was contributing to the social injustice people are fighting for today.
