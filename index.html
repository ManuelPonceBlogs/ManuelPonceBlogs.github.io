			I grew up here in Austin, TX. I graduated from Austin High School right downtown next to Zilker Park, so pretty much as Austin as it gets. 
			The only extra curricular activity I did in highschool was play fútbol since I have played that since I was a very small child. 
			
			<br><br> Choosing to attend UT Austin was my only option since I wanted to stay in Austin. It was also the only school I applied to after attending Austin
			Community for two years. Picking CS as a major was a mistake because at ACC I followed the wrong degree plan but by the time I figured that out I basically 
			was done with my two years there.
			
			<br><br> The reason I am in this class is to create some cool web app with others. I would like it to recreate the work enviroment that we are presented with 
			at internships since that is when I have felt like I learn the most in this field. My expectations for this class are not much. I think it will be very 
			independent learning and time heavy. The cold calling is something that I personally do not like. Mostly because I live at home where there is a million 
			distractions out of my control and sometimes have to be called out of my room randomly during class to handle things for my parents or pets or brother so I might miss the
			part where I get called and don't answer.
			
			<br><br> Recently, since I cannot play fútbol because of the situation in the United States, I have picked up Skateboarding. And yesterday I finally was able to drop 
			in to the big mini ramp at the skatepark so that made me happy.

			WHAT DID U DO THIS PAST WEEK?_
			This past week I did the minimum of attending lectures and paying attention. One thing I did was read some of my classmates' first blog posts to get to know people in my class this semester in case I do end up on their team, I'll have a very minimal background on them.
			
			<br><br> WHATS IN YOUR WAY?_
			For me, there's only so much I can understand from just being shown a screen about things like the makefile. When I do learn it is when it is hands-on, so when eventually we make our makefile or have to work with one, I do think my understanding will be greater than what it currently is. 
			
			<br><br> WHAT WILL YOU DO THIS WEEK?_
			This upcoming week I plan to attend lectures again, be better prepared for the quizzes and start the project. From what was explained about the project in the last lecture, it seems that it will be a lot and I am kinda intimidated by the whole workflow aspect more so than the coding part. Hopefully, I start it on Monday so in case I get stuck early I can take advantage of the TA office hours.
			
			<br><br> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE MAKEFILE?_
			overall looking at it as a whole I do see its purpose but when I start looking at individual lines I definitely get lost in the sauce. I do try my best to google most things that I cannot understand while I am reading the file. I do like how this given makefile has things very organized and comments that help out a lot so that was nice. Again, working on this file during the project will help me out to learn this material.
			
			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH DOCKER?_
			I have no successful experience with docker. In community college one of my CS professors was obsessed with this technology but I did not understand what he was talking about at all in class since it was a Comp Arch class. He gave us an extra credit assignment about using docker to run anything cool. I tried using docker to set up a video game lobby but failed since this was like my second semester in a CS class. 

			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH ASSERTIONS?_
			Assertions are cool to me. I have used them plenty of times in my code when I needed to make sure my code was running through a specific block of code. I mostly rely on print statements but when that fails I resort to assertions so definitely not using them how this class and other more professional codebases are using them. Hopefully, I can build up my skills to get to that point when using this tool.

			<br><br>WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH UNIT TESTS?_
			I have written unit tests for classes before but I know for a fact they were not good. Nobody wants to write tests for the simple code we have written in the past. I do have also experience writing unit tests a little in my internships but mainly it's better to write functional tests. 
			<br><br>WHAT MADE YOU HAPPY THIS WEEK_
			I got new soccer cleats. Even though I cannot use them, they'll be there when the time comes. 
			<br><br> PICK OF THE WEEK_
			I have always been a big fan of music and creation of music. Looking into what I could do with this class and a web project,I found Jukebox from OpenAI. It is a neural net that generates music, including rudimentary singing, as raw audio in a variety of genres and artist styles. I think it would be cool to integrate this into a website people could use to make sounds.
