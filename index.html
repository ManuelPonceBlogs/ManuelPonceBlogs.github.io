			This depiction of what an elite tomb setup of how they placed the elite upside down and in the fetal position. Surrounded by not only valuable ornaments 
			silver ores, but they required fuel that most used llama dung or moss found at high altitudes. 
			This position was different comapared to the Moche culture where they baried their dead laying down. 
			This gives insight to how its possible how Sican culture changed their perspective of the afterlife and believed in rebirth after death.
			These funerary practices suggests the existance of an elite lineage and how the elite maintain power even after death.

		<div class="panel allText">
			Human sacrifice was something the Sican Culture also played a role in. Two different examples about how human sacrafices could be percieved would be with two different Huacas. In Hueca del Loro, burials of young woman carefully placed around the elite.
			In Huaca Las Ventanas, most of the bodies belong to men and their placement was not structured around the elite. It has been suggested that in Huaca Las Ventanas belonged to volunteers that participated in rituals that explored the idea 
			creation of life through death. 
			<br> With the ceremonial knifes those were carefully crafted to portray Elites in their society.
