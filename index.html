			I grew up here in Austin, TX. I graduated from Austin High School right downtown next to Zilker Park, so pretty much as Austin as it gets. 
			The only extra curricular activity I did in highschool was play fútbol since I have played that since I was a very small child. 
			
			<br><br> Choosing to attend UT Austin was my only option since I wanted to stay in Austin. It was also the only school I applied to after attending Austin
			Community for two years. Picking CS as a major was a mistake because at ACC I followed the wrong degree plan but by the time I figured that out I basically 
			was done with my two years there.
			
			<br><br> The reason I am in this class is to create some cool web app with others. I would like it to recreate the work enviroment that we are presented with 
			at internships since that is when I have felt like I learn the most in this field. My expectations for this class are not much. I think it will be very 
			independent learning and time heavy. The cold calling is something that I personally do not like. Mostly because I live at home where there is a million 
			distractions out of my control and sometimes have to be called out of my room randomly during class to handle things for my parents or pets or brother so I might miss the
			part where I get called and don't answer.
			
			<br><br> Recently, since I cannot play fútbol because of the situation in the United States, I have picked up Skateboarding. And yesterday I finally was able to drop 
			in to the big mini ramp at the skatepark so that made me happy.
